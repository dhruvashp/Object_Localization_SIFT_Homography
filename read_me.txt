To run code - 

1. Use Jupyter Notebook (last run results should be there)

2. Make sure HW3_Code file and HW3_Data folder are in same folder (once the zip has been extracted and downloaded)

3. Run the notebook (Run all)

4. Make sure that you press a key when image window pops up - the visualizations pop up as the code runs and the code run will halt till a key is pressed (done to show visualizations as the code runs) 

5. The output dictionaries contain relevant details 

6. Note that the result folders are generated during run time - when the code is run the already present result folders will be deleted, new folders will be created and populated with result data. To ensure that old results are always available I've copied all result folders into a RESULTS folder. Thus the folders alongside HW3_Data and HW3_Code will be the latest run folders, the folders in the RESULTS folder are my run results always there for reference.
